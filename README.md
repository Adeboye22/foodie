## Description
Foodie is a food delivery application where users can browse through a catalogue of foods prepared by various restaurants and make orders. This application is built to give restaurants a wider reach and also give customers a wide variety of food options to choose from. Foodie is targeted at office workers, bachelors, lazy chefs, and individuals or families looking to have a wide range of options without having to make all the dishes themselves.

## Features
Foodie is a full-stack web application comprising an API and a client-side the user interacts with. Users can browse through a catalogue of foods and add them to their cart, make orders and pay from the application.

The API allows for create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations for users, restaurants, and food items by already registered restaurants.

## Installation
This application is built using nodejs and packages hosted on the npm repository. To install and run the application on your local machine, you need to have node installed. To run both the client and server side of the application, you need third-party software MongoDB server installed and running to be able to run the client side of the application.
* Clone the repository in your machine.
* Navigate into the root folder of the application from your terminal.
* Run the command `npm run install` to install all the packages used for developing the application. If you are only interested in the client-side or server-side,`npm run install-client` and `npm run install-server` installs their respective packages.
* After installation of the packages, you can run the command `npm run start-app` to start the client-side and the server-side. Note: the package.json in the root folder contains commands to run the client-side and server-side independently.
* The client-side is launched automatically in a browser and the API routes are ready to receive user requests.
